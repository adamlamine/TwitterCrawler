"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Sorry Bill, but this money should be being spent in the UK, lifting children out of poverty, putting an end to food banks, etc. Try reading some of the UN reports on UK poverty, abuse of disabled people by the government. You might change your mind."

@theresa_may @BillGates While spending £billions in foreign aid the streets of Britain are turning into war zones because apparently we can't afford to have them properly policed and public services in general are overstretched and under staffed because we can't afford to pay staff.

@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates At last somebody sees the good side if UK PM.
"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Bill, get off your ego, & ask why the U.K. squanders cash on 3rd world despots whilst NHS workers have to use food banks because their salaries have been cut? Or why we have so many homeless on our streets? Are you going to send aid to the U.K.?"
@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Too bad she won't help the poor and unfortunate in her own country.
@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Totally agree with foreign aid yes but 0.7% is really just too high at the moment unless of course I am mistaken and we are now out of austerity measures. Also Theresa speaks so confidently but we haven’t a clue what Brexit will entail for us as hardworking taxpayers.
@theresa_may @BillGates All for foreign aid !!!
@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Gotta ask.... why is Bill gates shilling ??
@GeorgiaStateU @BillGates U r right sir.. it's also happen in India.
@MandyRheaWrites @BillGates I have ideas for you to change the world. How can I tell you?You can message me via what app. 84913865679
@theresa_may @BillGates An American praising Theresa May would be like a British person saying that Donald Trump is the greater American President ever.
"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Disgusting truth: you two are cited on the Bill of Sale for me & my cultural artifacts when I was sold as a slave.@UNHumanRights And I came to your state's aid as Akasai Lig, when US, UK, denied my citizenry.Slaughtering worked. You fake money & lies do nothing. Bring guns."
@BillGates @10DowningStreet @theresa_may Sorry Bill-in my experience bunging #ForeignAid willy nilly simply benefits #Crooks ! #PcJobsWorth
"@10DowningStreet @BillGates @theresa_may says this, and yet cannot help her own country’s health service when they are seriously in debt! She also cannot help the poor and homeless out of poverty! Pot and kettle come to mind with the #PrimeMinister"
"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates That doesn't mean the UK should pay more than anyone else except, of course, if you happen to be American."
@theresa_may @BillGates Gates.. your money has insulated you from reality & sense.  For the UK to be giving away a blanket 0.7% when our NHS is broken and on it's knees is a national scandal.  Pensioners selling their homes so they can pay to die in a private nursing home is disgusting!
"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Is Mr Gates going to dig into his pockets and pay for this Foreign aid, as we have a not few  British subjects in poverty in the uk?"
"@theresa_may @BillGates Don't be ridiculous, you obviously know absolutely nothing about her.  She is an evil, selfish woman leading the most corrupt UK government in modern times.  She is in the process of ruining our country, especially the lives of young people. Shame on you."
"@theresa_may @10DowningStreet @BillGates Just words, Bill ... do hold her to account though so she delivers and please ask her teh difficult questions if she (in your eyes) fails."

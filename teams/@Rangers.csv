@Rangers #Rangers A bit in the shadows. Perhaps a different time or setting
@MartinPerez33D @carlostocci @Rangers This gives a whole new definition to ‚Äúthe scrub table‚Äù. üòÜ
@MartinPerez33D @carlostocci @Rangers Imagine getting to meet an MLB player and it's Carlos Tocci
@MikeMinor36 @Rangers Go rangers let's win it today and call this series a. Tie gl rangers !!!!! pic.twitter.com/bvG0xHxSI0
@MartinPerez33D @carlostocci @Rangers I don't know her name but I've run into her at more than one game. She is definitely at number one fan status.
@Rangers Definitely the most handsome babes in the MLB!
Hey...@EmilyJonesMcCoy isn‚Äôt in that photo!  She is just as much a @Rangers as any of those guys!
@Rangers I see the Choo!
"@Rangers Hi, we‚Äôre a Major League Baseball team"
@Rangers Needs more Delino...
@Rangers Where‚Äôs @LinoDeShields ?
@Rangers you guys should redesign the logo. Simplify it. Logo as is- is terrible.
@MikeMinor36 @Rangers Here‚Äôs a quick look at Mike Minor!#TexasRangers #mlb pic.twitter.com/evki3nwgKm
@Rangers Where is @EmilyJonesMcCoy !!! I don't see her... hmmm
@Rangers Delino dissed again.
@Rangers Whoo hoooo
@Rangers Your 2018 astros! Since they like to copy things üòÇ
@Rangers I'm on my way now. I just wish the autograph Wednesdays weren't exclusive to 13 and under people. Some of us get really no chance to meet baseball stars anywhere!
@Rangers A fun team to watch tbh despite the injuries!
@Rangers Trash bags.

@Rangers Best team we‚Äôve ever had
@MikeMinor36 @Rangers Go Rangers!!!
"@Rangers It's too heavy schedule, Isn' t it ?"
"@Rangers In case you're not aware, fans don't come to see the Rangers play, they come to see them win! Several years ago you had one of the best Minor League systems now they suck! Daniels needs to go and scouting needs to be re-done!"
@Rangers Thanks for helping others.

@Rangers Who will be signing at Alumni Alley this weekend?

@ElvisandrusSS1 @ColeHamels @Rangers You owe the rangers money back for halfassing it for all the years.
@Rangers No offense to Jurado but I was expecting to lose and win on Wednesday when minor pitched minor is pitching lights out I think we will grab the W tonight #TexasRangers
@MLB @Rangers That could have been a wrist buster. But you know it will be sore.
@Rangers What happened to the team out there?

@ElvisandrusSS1 @Rangers If we wanted  to listen  to Daniels  & Tingler  would  have turned  on a sports  show ! This is supposed  to be a baseball  game ! !
@ElvisandrusSS1 @Rangers Pissed poor  pitching !
@Rangers blow up that whole team y‚Äôall are üöÆ
@ElvisandrusSS1 @Rangers Rangers look like crap tonight.
@Rangers The Cc said the announcers calling Bellinger‚Äôs triple referred to him as Torey Bellinger.   It‚Äôs actually Cody Bellinger & he was the 2017 NL ROY.
@Rangers can we at least try to get the out!?!?!
@Rangers WHY IS BUTLER STILL PITCHING ???? DO THEY SEE WHAT WE SEE LOL ?
@Rangers trying to watch a game tell your sports announcers to talk about the game and less b.s
@ElvisandrusSS1 @Rangers Way to go!!!

"@Rangers yall should start using pretzel sticks as the skewer in the corndogs, no more worries about getting splinters from the wooden skewer and you can eat it afterwards."
@Rangers @FOXSportsSW Just because you don't care about watching the game does NOT mean we don't care! Stop talking about other things and Stop doing interviews while the game is on!
"@Rangers @FOXSportsSW  STOP the interviews during the game! We want to  watch the game and listen to commentary on the game, not on other  things."

"@Rangers  why are you interviewing Jon Daniels during the game? I tune into the  game to watch the game, not you interviewing people. Please STOP! If the  analytics were so good, why aren't the Rangers doing better?"
@Rangers Did I just hear that GLP was the park with the most runs and HR this year? Wow
"@Rangers @FOXSportsSW  Why don't you do your interviews before or after the game? We want to  watch the game and listen to commentary on the game, not on other  things."
@Rangers It‚Äôs be nice if they‚Äôd call the game instead of talking to the GM!  Nobody gives a s$&t we want to hear the game being called!!!!!!!
@Rangers Turn on the radar gun.
@Rangers #mitelcall HR for Chirinos. It‚Äôs his bobble head night!!

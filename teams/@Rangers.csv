@Rangers Whoo hoooo
@Rangers You need to put a better product on the field.
@Rangers How many more losing seasons until we can banister????
@Rangers Let's support the Rangers
@Rangers Probably broke a bat in the dugout after that
@Rangers Wish your record was as pretty as that team picture 😏

"@Rangers I really want some of your giveaway stuff, but I don't live in Texas and can't make it to any games. Is there somewhere we can buy some of the bobble heads? I really want the Beltre/Andrus bobble heads."
@Rangers I have unsubscribed from your emails at least a half dozen times but I still get emails from you. Stop harassing me with your emails when I have clearly asked you to stop.

@Rangers Great picture
@Rangers Oh that sucks but hey beltre stealing that base last night was awesome it would have been more interesting if Guzman were to hit a fare ball but we lose anyway. And martin Perez is no longer a starter he is a reliever and he might not come back next year I'm proud of that
@Rangers Hello squad.
@Rangers Can’t sssssttttand Puig 👎🏼🐖 Burrrrrnn odioso

@Rangers Will there be enough dollar dogs for everyone next year? #baitandswitch
@Rangers Mike Minor should easily be in the rotation next year
@Rangers Love my Texas Rangers always
@Rangers Like if you’re not surprised
@Rangers Can’t relate
"@Rangers Adrian Beltre got a stolen base tonight, making this the 8th year in a row he has exactly 1 steal (assuming he gets no more the rest of the year.) As I said pre-season, if your #FantasyBaseball team needs exactly 1 SB, he's your guy!  #MLB"
@Rangers Guzman very badly today at the baton. Banister seeing him 0-3 could very well have put someone else's power!!!

@Rangers He’s no one’s friend...
"@Rangers broadcasters are shady towards Dodger fans rn because they're getting smashed. Please stick to calling the game and don't worry about which provider we watch the game on, be grateful people are even tuning in cause this is probably the only time people watch you. 😂"
@Rangers Where are the rest of us? Lol
@Rangers terrible service!!
@Rangers The Rangers ran out of hot dogs in dollar hot dog night 🌭 😡. Thanks for making me wait in line #baitanswitch #scam #fraud #scheme #nodogs

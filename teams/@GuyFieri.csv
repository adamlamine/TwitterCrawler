"@BobClausen4 @GuyFieri If you do come back, you need to take the short trip to the little town of Marianna to visit (James Beard Award Winning) Jones' BBQ. It's operated out of an old house, has been around forever, and would certainly be worth your time.)"
"@GuyFieri Hey Guy, I'm a big fan of yours and watch you all the time on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives. One episode you were wearing some sweet looking chrome sunglasses. Is there any possible way you would send me that pair if you still have em? Peace and Love brotha!"

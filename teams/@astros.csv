@astros Not sure how it happens when a full grown man puts on a baseball uniform but it transforms him right back into a kid on a sandlot.  It's a beautiful thing.
@astros The best thing I love about our Astros is that they all just seem to get along so well - makes the game so much more fun for them - and US!
@astros yessssirrrr
@astros I think @tonykemp's 1st bobblehead should be of him jumping up at hitting that gum tray out the way! Thus saving @JustinVerlander noggin from taking a beating. 😆 One of the most memorable non plays of the  year!! #NeverSettle #MLB #KempinAintEasy

@astros I am glad we won but we have issues to address. Altuve needs to stop swinging at pitches so far out of the strike zone Opposing pitchers know our tendencies and bank on us getting ourselves out.  I wish we could adopt Bregman's approach of only looking for pitches in certain zone

@astros Give white correa contract. correa is ruined
@astros Oakland your window has closed!
@astros #tylerwhite let’s gooooooo
@astros @Astros need a Sharkoff!
@astros wow most uneventful 9th inning a team can have whybis it A’s can put pressure on astros but astros just sit on their rings........😡
@astros Hopefully we hit a home run if not we will lose in extras cuz our coach can’t play basic baseball and everyone knows it
@astros Let's go Astro
"@astros Correa is overrated. He’s been awful. Swing at dumb pitches, but watches strikes."
@astros Showrea needs to show more
@astros Shark walks it off
@astros Everyone needs to channel @ABREG_1 !  Let’s get this win in walk-off fashion!
@astros Osuna sure beat them good that inning ...oops
"@astros Yeah because management is trash, play small ball, avoid double plays advance players but nooooooo"
@astros If we lose it’s on Altuve and Correa today. Beyond awful at the plate on big moments in this game
@JoseAltuve27 @astros #Astronomical
@JoseAltuve27 @MichaelBerrySho @astros The Shift put standard ground ball to 4 nearly out of reach.
@JoseAltuve27 @JavierRM1228 @astros Awesome
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Oh man. lol
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Let’s go Astros!
@JoseAltuve27 Hahahahaha @astros tweeting about defense b/c there’s no offense to brag about.
@JoseAltuve27 @astros really don't care about his defense when he keeps striking out w/ RISP
@JoseAltuve27 @astros The offense 😱😱
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Got him!
@astros Love him
@JoseAltuve27 @astros If only we could have hit into one Lesa double play before ABreg comes to bat. #stopdoingthat
"@astros The frustrating thing for me this season is free swinging, swinging at balls. It just leads to double plays and strikeouts. For example Kemp was just on first with zero outs, now there’s two outs with nobody on base."
@JoseAltuve27 @astros sow that was going to be a run thanks springer. Please hold someone reliable for this hitting
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Can Altuve be clutch for us again? We really need him to show up today
@JoseAltuve27 @astros freakin' double play AGAIN!
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Can we play small ball? Geez...
@astros Hinch needs an alarm clock to wake the f up...manage the game
@astros Another GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY with bases loaded SQUANDERED!
"@astros awesome, more runner left in scoring position ffs"
@astros wow a hitter in our line-up that didn’t try to hit the ball out of the complex with the roof closed! That’s called hitting
@astros What's up with Altuve and Springer??
@astros Yea we are losing this game
@astros This just isn't looking good even in a tie
@astros That’s ok...we just suck right now
@astros Altuve and Correa are human windmills today.
@astros 4 hitter Correa whiffs also. What else is new! OVERRATED!
@astros Hard when the core hitters won’t hit.
@astros Hinch is too reactive...needs to be proactive
@astros Your pitcher gives up back to back walks in a 1 run game and you not only leave him in but he walks the bases loaded and you still leave him in and you only pull him after he hits a batter and forces a run in. In a 1 run game he should have been yanked after the 2nd walk.
@astros LET'S GO!!!!!👏👏💥💥💥
@astros Altuve should of just swung at ball 5.😂😂😂
@astros Our 3 hitter with 4 whiffs today! And Correa is next. Oh brother!
@astros #NeverSettle pic.twitter.com/UaRTK36qsf
@astros Go 'Stros! Go!
@astros Why the hell is Sipp even an option to pitch.  He is almost as bad as Harris.  Giving up runs always
@astros Why should Altuve have a such a small strike zone?   In a few years ooompa loompas will dominate mlb
@astros Hate having to get a run back when it was a pure gift.
@astros Or two or three
@astros Let’s not leave a guy in when he walks 2 in a row!?
@astros AJ Hinch ties it up at 4 with Peacock! Great job!
@astros These announcers are horrible!  No replay on Piscotti getting hit on hand?   Or even a mention.
@ABREG_1 @astros MVP Alex Bregman
@astros Great catch Springer
@astros Awesome LSU 🐅 . Very proud.
@astros Hinch is blowing this game. Only everybody in the world (except Hinch) knew early on that Peacock was awful today.
@astros Hinch always takes too long to take a pitcher out
@astros AJ HINCH! Waits until THEY TIE IT UP to change out Peacock. This team just doesn't look they want this game bad enough today. Make that last and tonight. Squandered scoring opportunities! Pitching giving up too many runs.
@astros Try 4-4 now and Peacock has now walked or hit 4 straight batters. Nice clutch pitching there. This Houston team doesn’t have the fortitude it did last year. It’s so lame how teams rest on their laurels and get complacent after winning a title as opposed to gunning for more.
@astros up by 1 late and you let your reliever walk 3 and hit one to tie the game! That’s a fucking managerial masterpiece! Well done dumbass!
@astros fuck peacock and fuck Hinch's dumbass for leaving him in to give up the game
@astros bullpen strikes again. Awesome.
@astros   Too Damn Late AJ
@astros @Astros should have left @kidkeuchy in for one more
"@astros here comes the bullpen collapse, should have blown this game open, too many missed opportunities on offense"
@astros @Astros shouldn’t that be 3 strikes on Lowrie? pic.twitter.com/067eZPMgds
"@astros #SPRINGERDINGER  great job, George!👍🏼👏🏻"
@astros Let’s go @Athletics
"@astros Correa ,Altuve and Guerrriel are really sucking lately! What’s wrong with them? Did anyone tell them we are in a division race?"
@astros Any thoughts on how early I should show up to actually get one?
"@astros ALEX I fell ya brother. Bring it on Yanks!Bring it on Boston! I can hardly contain the excitement and we're not even full strength yet. This post season has the potential to top last season, which to me was the most exciting I'd ever been apart of. BRING IT! #NeverSettle"
@astros Can’t believe Altuve and Correa both choked!  How is that possible?!  That is NOT championship baseball!
@astros Gotta hold the lead
@astros Bregman remember him the other allstar for the Stros.Who wants some? Bring it Boston! Bring it Yanks! We're not even at our best yet. Just wait you'll find out very soon!😉 #NeverSettle https://twitter.com/astros/status/1034889193409982464 …
"@astros man we do all the little things at home to lose 1-2 run ball games. DP, Altuve and Correa looking at strikes down the middle, Dallas throwing meatballs, and reflief pitching giving up the lead......hang out to a lead for once stros"
@astros We probably will regret that one.  Can't play around with the A's.  The rest of the line up needs Bregs plate discipline to make shit happen in the future.
@astros Good job Bregman! Too bad there's nothing happening after him today. CORREA SUCKS in the Cleanup spot.
@astros The 2 behind Bregman follow with shit.😂😂😂
@astros And altuve and Correa k...😫
"@astros more wasted opportunities, unacceptable for our 3/4 hitter to do nothing with the bases loaded and allowing Oakland to stay in this game"
"@astros And with bases loaded 1 out you can’t do a single thing further. How bout putting the game out of reach and just sitting back and enjoying the win?? No, you’d rather keep it a one run game. The A’s just flat out have more heart than you do. Can’t deny it."
@astros wow altuve and correa holding this team down i kniw altuve has hits but selfish at bats when we need them to come through.....
@astros Altuve with another Whiff with RISP! Now Correa will probably Whiff also. I hope I'm wrong!
"@astros come on Jose, can't strike out with the bases loaded man"
@astros MVP 😉😎 pic.twitter.com/2fQu6UTWVu
@astros They scared of the man
@astros Bregman has become our second best player easily. His poise and ability to remain calm/slow things down in huge situations is unbelievable

@astros I miss when Keuchel was virtually unbeatable at home 😔
@astros Kuechel fast ball is 89 mph. That’s going to get lit up every time. He’s not the same as last year
"@astros At this moment,Dallas has to be a little frustrated. Altuve misplaying that ball with that shift and Kemp not hanging on to that ball,two outs right there."
@astros Correa needs to sit out a few games and think 🤔 about it.
@astros It sucks all the hitters regressed this year except for like 3.
@astros Remind me again why they traded Laureano.
@astros The league has figured out dallas. He does not get low calls anore and his 90 mph fastball is AAA level. Smh starting pitchig gased now and our bipolar offense is going to lose another 1 run game
@astros y’all bullshittin too @kidkeuchy bro wtf you acting like oprah.. “doubles for everybody” cmon man give your team a chance
"@astros Fucking Kuechel throwing BP out there, this game is over, way to not take care of business at home, AGAIN"
@astros Lets get some runs back!
@astros can y’all do this one time for us please lol https://twitter.com/asap_sportsnews/status/1034629475034644480 …
@astros account tweeted that 2-0 score and been radio silent since. I should’ve known..smh
@astros What's shameful is that no one fears them at home.
@astros So...is the offense done for today?
@astros Each starter is good for giving up about 5 runs a night.  If this don't tighten up it's a wrap.
@astros God Dallas Keuchel is totally worthless. The astros are showing that they don’t have quite the heart the A’s do. Pretty pathetic to watch defending champs just get punked on their home turf. This game is already over. The Astros won’t be coming back today. Oakland wants it more.
@astros I see Kuechel is at his normal routine of giving away our leads
@astros y’all better get that pitcher outta there before it’s too late 🤦🏾‍♂️
@astros #pos gave it up
@astros no more showboating
@astros @RealToddKalas That ball hit that A in the foot off first base. WTH! No review?!?!?!

@astros @ajhinch Correa in cleanup hasn't really gone that way yet in 2018. Why have a 250 hitter batting cleanup? I guess we have to give the A's an out somewhere in the lineup. And Gurriel is in the 6 spot? Should be 1.Springer 2.Breg 3.Altuve 4.White 5.Yuli 6.Correa hot bats move up

"@astros Astros had their chances,we are looking at you…springer,altuve and Correa.Not going to complain too much bc the Astros were riding a 6 game winning streak,can’t win them all,but I am hoping they win this series.Lets go Astros!"
@astros God damn
@astros Still the best team in the league.
@astros Pretty typical the Stros only score 3 after scoring 11 the game before.

"@astros Osuna isn't much better than Giles. Potential rally in the 8th killer by Springer getting greedy, Altuve and Correa whiffing. Correa is overrated at the plate. Strikes out way too much in big moments. White would have been better in the 4 spot the way he's been hitting."
"@astros Giles got his 18th save 2 days ago. Also, he only punches himself."

@astros GGs. Ya'll played hard!
@astros Is Hinch experimenting with the bullpen? They can throw more than 10 pitches. Hope he gets it figured out...go stros
@astros a lot of selfish play - and quit taking gurriel out of the line up no more rest for the main players
@astros No worries @Athletics won’t win the division with that trash starting pitching rotation.
@astros  pic.twitter.com/pJQgzKwrUK
"@astros Need Correa to be the RBI machine we all think he can be.  He’s waaayyy to timid for batting with RISP, while Altuve’s never met a first pitch he doesn’t like."
@astros Someone call Osuna’s significant other and let her know he blew the save.
"@astros Love this team, just hurts when we can’t play up to our level. We seem to drop a level when playing division rivals lately. Let’s forget this one and try to win the series"
@astros why are other teams smarter than Astros - the guy threw out someone this year from the center field wall to first do not go stringer

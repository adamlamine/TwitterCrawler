@astros NOBODY GET HURT!!!!!!
@astros YESSSSSS SIRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!
@astros I am glad we won but we have issues to address. Altuve needs to stop swinging at pitches so far out of the strike zone Opposing pitchers know our tendencies and bank on us getting ourselves out.  I wish we could adopt Bregman's approach of only looking for pitches in certain zone

@astros wow most uneventful 9th inning a team can have whybis it A’s can put pressure on astros but astros just sit on their rings........😡
@astros Hopefully we hit a home run if not we will lose in extras cuz our coach can’t play basic baseball and everyone knows it
@astros Let's go Astro
"@astros Correa is overrated. He’s been awful. Swing at dumb pitches, but watches strikes."
@astros Showrea needs to show more
@astros Shark walks it off
@astros Everyone needs to channel @ABREG_1 !  Let’s get this win in walk-off fashion!
@astros Osuna sure beat them good that inning ...oops
"@astros Yeah because management is trash, play small ball, avoid double plays advance players but nooooooo"
@astros If we lose it’s on Altuve and Correa today. Beyond awful at the plate on big moments in this game
@JoseAltuve27 @astros #Astronomical

@JoseAltuve27 @astros The offense 😱😱
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Got him!
@astros Love him
@JoseAltuve27 @astros If only we could have hit into one Lesa double play before ABreg comes to bat. #stopdoingthat
"@astros The frustrating thing for me this season is free swinging, swinging at balls. It just leads to double plays and strikeouts. For example Kemp was just on first with zero outs, now there’s two outs with nobody on base."
@JoseAltuve27 @astros sow that was going to be a run thanks springer. Please hold someone reliable for this hitting
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Can Altuve be clutch for us again? We really need him to show up today
@JoseAltuve27 @astros freakin' double play AGAIN!
@JoseAltuve27 @astros Can we play small ball? Geez...
@astros Hinch needs an alarm clock to wake the f up...manage the game
@astros Another GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY with bases loaded SQUANDERED!
"@astros awesome, more runner left in scoring position ffs"
@astros wow a hitter in our line-up that didn’t try to hit the ball out of the complex with the roof closed! That’s called hitting
@astros What's up with Altuve and Springer??
@astros Yea we are losing this game
@astros This just isn't looking good even in a tie
@astros That’s ok...we just suck right now
@astros Altuve and Correa are human windmills today.
@astros 4 hitter Correa whiffs also. What else is new! OVERRATED!
@astros Hard when the core hitters won’t hit.
@astros Hinch is too reactive...needs to be proactive
@astros Your pitcher gives up back to back walks in a 1 run game and you not only leave him in but he walks the bases loaded and you still leave him in and you only pull him after he hits a batter and forces a run in. In a 1 run game he should have been yanked after the 2nd walk.
@astros LET'S GO!!!!!👏👏💥💥💥
@astros Altuve should of just swung at ball 5.😂😂😂
@astros Our 3 hitter with 4 whiffs today! And Correa is next. Oh brother!
@astros #NeverSettle pic.twitter.com/UaRTK36qsf
@astros Go 'Stros! Go!
@astros Why the hell is Sipp even an option to pitch.  He is almost as bad as Harris.  Giving up runs always
@astros Why should Altuve have a such a small strike zone?   In a few years ooompa loompas will dominate mlb
@astros Hate having to get a run back when it was a pure gift.
@astros Or two or three
@astros Let’s not leave a guy in when he walks 2 in a row!?
@astros AJ Hinch ties it up at 4 with Peacock! Great job!
@astros These announcers are horrible!  No replay on Piscotti getting hit on hand?   Or even a mention.
@ABREG_1 @astros MVP Alex Bregman
@astros Great catch Springer
@astros Awesome LSU 🐅 . Very proud.
@astros Hinch is blowing this game. Only everybody in the world (except Hinch) knew early on that Peacock was awful today.
@astros Hinch always takes too long to take a pitcher out
@astros AJ HINCH! Waits until THEY TIE IT UP to change out Peacock. This team just doesn't look they want this game bad enough today. Make that last and tonight. Squandered scoring opportunities! Pitching giving up too many runs.
@astros Try 4-4 now and Peacock has now walked or hit 4 straight batters. Nice clutch pitching there. This Houston team doesn’t have the fortitude it did last year. It’s so lame how teams rest on their laurels and get complacent after winning a title as opposed to gunning for more.
@astros up by 1 late and you let your reliever walk 3 and hit one to tie the game! That’s a fucking managerial masterpiece! Well done dumbass!
@astros fuck peacock and fuck Hinch's dumbass for leaving him in to give up the game
@astros bullpen strikes again. Awesome.
@astros   Too Damn Late AJ
@astros @Astros should have left @kidkeuchy in for one more
"@astros here comes the bullpen collapse, should have blown this game open, too many missed opportunities on offense"
@astros @Astros shouldn’t that be 3 strikes on Lowrie? pic.twitter.com/067eZPMgds
"@astros #SPRINGERDINGER  great job, George!👍🏼👏🏻"
@astros Let’s go @Athletics
"@astros Correa ,Altuve and Guerrriel are really sucking lately! What’s wrong with them? Did anyone tell them we are in a division race?"
@astros Any thoughts on how early I should show up to actually get one?
"@astros ALEX I fell ya brother. Bring it on Yanks!Bring it on Boston! I can hardly contain the excitement and we're not even full strength yet. This post season has the potential to top last season, which to me was the most exciting I'd ever been apart of. BRING IT! #NeverSettle"
@astros Can’t believe Altuve and Correa both choked!  How is that possible?!  That is NOT championship baseball!
@astros Gotta hold the lead
@astros Bregman remember him the other allstar for the Stros.Who wants some? Bring it Boston! Bring it Yanks! We're not even at our best yet. Just wait you'll find out very soon!😉 #NeverSettle https://twitter.com/astros/status/1034889193409982464 …
"@astros man we do all the little things at home to lose 1-2 run ball games. DP, Altuve and Correa looking at strikes down the middle, Dallas throwing meatballs, and reflief pitching giving up the lead......hang out to a lead for once stros"
@astros We probably will regret that one.  Can't play around with the A's.  The rest of the line up needs Bregs plate discipline to make shit happen in the future.
@astros Good job Bregman! Too bad there's nothing happening after him today. CORREA SUCKS in the Cleanup spot.
@astros The 2 behind Bregman follow with shit.😂😂😂
@astros And altuve and Correa k...😫
"@astros more wasted opportunities, unacceptable for our 3/4 hitter to do nothing with the bases loaded and allowing Oakland to stay in this game"
"@astros And with bases loaded 1 out you can’t do a single thing further. How bout putting the game out of reach and just sitting back and enjoying the win?? No, you’d rather keep it a one run game. The A’s just flat out have more heart than you do. Can’t deny it."
@astros wow altuve and correa holding this team down i kniw altuve has hits but selfish at bats when we need them to come through.....
@astros Altuve with another Whiff with RISP! Now Correa will probably Whiff also. I hope I'm wrong!
"@astros come on Jose, can't strike out with the bases loaded man"
@astros MVP 😉😎 pic.twitter.com/2fQu6UTWVu
@astros They scared of the man
@astros Bregman has become our second best player easily. His poise and ability to remain calm/slow things down in huge situations is unbelievable
Bregman follows with a bases-loaded walk! 4-3 #Astros! pic.twitter.com/T0CJapjsWM

@astros I miss when Keuchel was virtually unbeatable at home 😔
@astros Get something  going lets win this Series   come on now all the Fans Need a win all Games
@astros Kuechel fast ball is 89 mph. That’s going to get lit up every time. He’s not the same as last year
"@astros At this moment,Dallas has to be a little frustrated. Altuve misplaying that ball with that shift and Kemp not hanging on to that ball,two outs right there."
@astros Correa needs to sit out a few games and think 🤔 about it.
@astros It sucks all the hitters regressed this year except for like 3.
@astros Remind me again why they traded Laureano.
@astros The league has figured out dallas. He does not get low calls anore and his 90 mph fastball is AAA level. Smh starting pitchig gased now and our bipolar offense is going to lose another 1 run game
@astros y’all bullshittin too @kidkeuchy bro wtf you acting like oprah.. “doubles for everybody” cmon man give your team a chance
"@astros Fucking Kuechel throwing BP out there, this game is over, way to not take care of business at home, AGAIN"
@astros Lets get some runs back!
@astros can y’all do this one time for us please lol https://twitter.com/asap_sportsnews/status/1034629475034644480 …
@astros account tweeted that 2-0 score and been radio silent since. I should’ve known..smh
@astros What's shameful is that no one fears them at home.
@astros So...is the offense done for today?
@astros Each starter is good for giving up about 5 runs a night.  If this don't tighten up it's a wrap.
@astros God Dallas Keuchel is totally worthless. The astros are showing that they don’t have quite the heart the A’s do. Pretty pathetic to watch defending champs just get punked on their home turf. This game is already over. The Astros won’t be coming back today. Oakland wants it more.
@astros I see Kuechel is at his normal routine of giving away our leads
@astros y’all better get that pitcher outta there before it’s too late 🤦🏾‍♂️
@astros #pos gave it up
@astros no more showboating
@astros @RealToddKalas That ball hit that A in the foot off first base. WTH! No review?!?!?!
"@astros @Astros that was a great catch - we can’t see a replay? Yes, against us but would like to see it again....."

@AstrosTrainGuy @astros Correa needs to be moved to 6 spot.  White should be clean up followed Yuli

@FITTEAMBallpark @astros See y'all there with another world series trophy!
@astros @ajhinch Correa in cleanup hasn't really gone that way yet in 2018. Why have a 250 hitter batting cleanup? I guess we have to give the A's an out somewhere in the lineup. And Gurriel is in the 6 spot? Should be 1.Springer 2.Breg 3.Altuve 4.White 5.Yuli 6.Correa hot bats move up
@SportsTalk790 @ATTSportsNetSW @astros 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘

"@astros Hey, I like A.J., but someone needs to tell him that Rondon needs to be our closer, like you know, he WAS. As for Osuna, if you're going to be given an undeserved second chance, you pretty much need to be perfect."
@astros Hope someone bets money on the A's to throw tomorrow's game away!
@astros Easy like
@astros Charlie Morton was pitiful last night
@astros Tomorrow is a new  http://ballgame.Now  go and win the series.
"@astros Couldn't afford an L against the second place team in your division, especially at this point in the season. Let's brush this off and win the rubber game tomorrow."

@astros God damn
@astros Still the best team in the league.
@astros Pretty typical the Stros only score 3 after scoring 11 the game before.

"@astros Osuna isn't much better than Giles. Potential rally in the 8th killer by Springer getting greedy, Altuve and Correa whiffing. Correa is overrated at the plate. Strikes out way too much in big moments. White would have been better in the 4 spot the way he's been hitting."
"@astros Giles got his 18th save 2 days ago. Also, he only punches himself."
@astros Just 1 game. Lace em up tomorrow and get’erdone
@astros Osuna will have to flee when he meets me. pic.twitter.com/ullZZ1IyY6

@astros GGs. Ya'll played hard!
@astros Is Hinch experimenting with the bullpen? They can throw more than 10 pitches. Hope he gets it figured out...go stros
@astros a lot of selfish play - and quit taking gurriel out of the line up no more rest for the main players
@astros No worries @Athletics won’t win the division with that trash starting pitching rotation.
@astros  pic.twitter.com/pJQgzKwrUK
"@astros Need Correa to be the RBI machine we all think he can be.  He’s waaayyy to timid for batting with RISP, while Altuve’s never met a first pitch he doesn’t like."
@astros Someone call Osuna’s significant other and let her know he blew the save.
"@astros Love this team, just hurts when we can’t play up to our level. We seem to drop a level when playing division rivals lately. Let’s forget this one and try to win the series"
@astros why are other teams smarter than Astros - the guy threw out someone this year from the center field wall to first do not go stringer

"@astros Springer, Altuve, and Correa have to be better than they were tonight in the 8th inning."
@astros It’s ridiculous that 3 of the 4 runs came off of a couple of walks and HBP
"@astros Not good, #NeverSettle. #Astros pic.twitter.com/E6Uuaojg2F"
@astros My fault guys I came to the game. Astros are 0-2 when I come I won’t come to anymore my apologies
@astros They only won by one. And it was on a ground rule double. Relax. Tomorrow's gonna be here before we know it.
@astros I identify this as a win.
@astros “Never make the first or last out at 3rd base” -my little league coach
@astros Cfm is falling off anybody else think so?
"@astros yo, can you follow me back real quick so i can dm you a question?"

@astros Lesson learned hopefully: don’t make an out at 3rd base especially late. Base running blunder cost us the game
@astros Good game though y'all will get them next time keep your head up #NeverSettle
"@astros I stand by what I said earlier. Correa should have stayed at CC. He had horrible ABs there during his rehab, and they rushed him back anyway."

@astros Shouldn’t have run to third on Bregman’s single. Never make an out at 3rd
@astros Welp.
@astros No hope.
@astros Gonna lose cause Correa forgot how to swing a bat on 2 perfect strikes down the middle. Amazing.
@astros We had our chances.
"@astros I miss Giles, he was clutch"

@astros That’s funny!
@astros Happy Birthday!
@astros Well...that was anticlimactic
@astros @ATTSportsNetSW Correa has to swing the bat. He’s to big a guy in our line up to watch 2 called strikes. So the Red Sox and Yankees are just going to throw only sliders and cut fast balls for an entire series?  What is going on with us right now?
@astros Correa what the hell are you looking at ?
"@astros Correa is pathetic at plate. Fastball, center cut, called 3rd strike. Pitiful. He needs to sit.."
@astros Please tell Correa he is allowed to swing the bat!

@MLB @astros Springer is Da Man!

@twhite409 @astros He hit!! Let’s gooooo!!
@astros Goat
with a single on the first pitch 🙌
@astros @JuliaMorales @blummer27 @RealToddKalas can someone please crack the code that explains the milking the cow motion they’re making when they get on base!!! It’s driving me insane
@astros @cchooks one/both of y'all should do a Grateful Dead night at the ballpark
@astros This offense is wild.  lol  Lights on lights off.
@astros @ATTSportsNetSW Nobody has more fun than our organization! pic.twitter.com/A48fjmHGuH
@astros I have to know. What’s the deal with the BB throwing every missed hit to the bald man behind the dugout? By the way..were having a blast #gostros ⚾️
@astros 👀👀👀👀👀
@astros @ATTSportsNetSW @RealToddKalas named our baby Houston. #worldseriesbaby #TwitterTuesday pic.twitter.com/XbuBpdyH4J
@astros This guy covering for blummer sounds like a used car salesmen.
@astros Let’s go Astros let’s kick some booty
@astros Lets win all Games Come on now #NeverSettle
"@astros We were down 0-4 this time last game, we’ve got this."
"@astros Can we stop using Morton against these shit biscuits? He’s a good pitcher, but the A’s turds have his number."
@astros Next Lowery bats don’t pitch around him.
@astros Charlie Morton is a scrub just so u know. How many guys he gonna go 0-2 count just to have the batter work into a full count. He pitches himself into trouble!! SMH
@astros Basically lol pic.twitter.com/GGVkfxlEcZ
@astros Ahh I miss the first half #CFM
@astros @JuliaMorales where is the @blummer27  on tonight’s telecast?
@astros @JuliaMorales @blummer27 Will we ever learn that the promotional innings have killed us just about every time they happen this year? We love the Astros and a commercial between innings is all we need to decide whether a promotion is what will drive us to show up to MMP.

@astros @AstrosOptimism ASTROS SUCK
@astros He such a bad azz he sent it back to the batter Impressed I am
@astros Oh my!
@astros He looks so excited.
"@astros We all want to know, What is this? Driving, milking or something else? pic.twitter.com/o6NsN1fYef"
@astros Because CFM! pic.twitter.com/i4SVDsDnkP
@astros why can’t Charlie Morton put hitters away anymore?
@astros and here comes the Morton Meltdown
@astros  https://wp.me/p9RpBo-gm 
@astros Yeah but how about do the Mariners a solid 😒
@astros @ATTSportsNetSW @MikeStanton29 3 innings in a row uncle Charlie has walked a batter with 2 outs. That’s a concentration problem in my mind. You can NOT walk hitters in MLB or it will bite you in the butt. Just like that. #StopItCharlie
@astros 3--1 boys. Eat it!! 😂😂🖕🖕
@astros Not a good Morton game sadly
@astros Lol

@astros We need to talk about you stealing our #NeverSettle hashtag. Can we at least add a 🏐 to the end of it?
@astros Ice that man has running in his veins. Impeccable catch!
@astros Super!!
@astros I'm literally just squinting my eyes thinking please don't get hurt please don't get hurt... Gotta love Springer!!!
@MLB @astros GOAT
@astros shane robinson better
@astros Whats up with the cow milking sign after a batter hits? what is that?? ;))
@astros @RealToddKalas I love to watch these Astros have fun but I do miss the days of watching the Conger-bot! https://goo.gl/images/wZB6WC 
@astros won't be no-hit tonight
@astros Was that a Springer Dinger? I think so. Good to have you back!
@MLB @astros Not gonna lie on the rewind I thought he was crumbling to the ground in pain. Thanks for the heart attack. Needed that.

@astros #NeverSettle
@astros @RealToddKalas @ATTSportsNetSW This is why I love this team. Not just the stare. But the was you can tell they love what they do and respect each other. I also love watching AJ try to not laugh at them. pic.twitter.com/udmGzTki5p

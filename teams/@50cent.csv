@50cent Get the strap pic.twitter.com/65HnD5TN7x
"@50cent Ok Kanan working w/the Feds... had a bulletproof vest, so he's not dead. FBI/NYPD wants TariQ to believe that so he think he got away w/murder. This leads back to all of them conspiring a cover up w/the main one going down-ANGELA!! They all testify against her 😂 #getthestrap"
@STARZ @50cent MNMNMNMN
"@50cent You know I have never watched power because it was either I was working late, fell asleep and the fact I didn’t have Starz. I think I am going to start watching. I hear a lot of good things."

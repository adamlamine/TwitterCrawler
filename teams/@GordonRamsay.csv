@GordonRamsay I just wanted to say THANKS for siding with Louis Makepeace concerning The HeartLESS  of Worcestershire College‚Äôs hospitality and catering course. It seems they are sorely lacking in HOSPITALITY & perhaps need a refresher course. Thanks Gordon üëçüëç
@HellsKitchenFOX @GordonRamsay Gordon....is there going to be another UK Hells Kitchen??
@GordonRamsay How does someone understand what is a great dish compared to a mediocre dish or a flat out horable dish. Do a show on this. Can I be on the first show. I don't know the difference and it hurts me.
@HellsKitchenFOX @GordonRamsay I can't wait to see your hard disgusted side come out. You are the best

@GordonRamsay I've been re-watching kitchen nightmares on Hulu and some of these episodes just pull on my heart strings. The way you mend not only their restraunt and foods but their families and hope. You really are an incredible man and its sooo refreshing to see you give back.
"@GordonRamsay have you ever considered a range of G.Ramsay kitchen bots that just sit in ur kitchen and yell motivational obscenities when people fuck it up? 'R we having a stroke for dinner, enough Fucking salt' & such classics?"
@HellsKitchenFOX @GordonRamsay I cannot freaking wait! Looks to another hellish season üòà
"@GordonRamsay I used to loath you but now I actually LOVE you, so it‚Äôs okay."
@GordonRamsay cracks me up üòÇ

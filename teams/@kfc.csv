@kfc Forcing two mash potatoes and that coleslaw? Whatever happened to pick your own sides?
@kfc I actually like the name and suggested Harland for my son’s name haha
@kfc My son’s initials are KFC and several folks have deemed him with the nickname “The Colonel” even though he doesn’t like to be called that.  Also his Birthday is a few days after the  9th.   That gotta count for something!!!!
@kfc should have chicken noodle soup

"@kfc is doing a contest. If you name your kid Harland and gave birth on 9-9-18, you'll be entered to win $11,000. That's different lol 😂"
"@kfc I can't wait to see how many people whore out their kids for $11,000 18 years from now (which will be worth way much less by then)..... Anyone who does this should be ashamed of themselves and probably aren't fit to be parents."

@kfc I actually really like that name.  I'd totally do it  !!
"@kfc my Harland was genuinely named after colonel sanders.  i’m not trying to finagle my way into $11,000 or anything but my Harland does love your mac and cheese so maybe you should hook him up.  his birthday is in september too so it’d be like a present from his namesake"

@kfc It's a shame the Colonel wasn't born in December since that is what we are naming out son due then!

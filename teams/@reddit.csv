"@reddit Hi. Do you consider linking to a public social media profile (like LinkedIn) to be ""personal information"" that mustn't be posted? If so, does this apply to all social media sites like Twitter, DeviantArt, YouTube, etc.?"
"@reddit It was “WTF - why can’t we have architecture, food, kind people, and beauty like they have here in Europe”"
@reddit :-:
@reddit if you continue to harass me and take over my entire mobile screen with your shitty advert / pop up trying to get me to use your app instead EVERY SINGLE TIME I will simply not go on / open your website at all. If that means anything to you...
@reddit I was stationed in Greece and when I was out in town I was told you can’t flush toilet paper because the plumbing is so old it can’t handle it. I did it anyway.
@reddit Why are you broken? REDDIT. Stop being broken!
"@reddit what's with the stability as of late, i been seeing the error messages more often than ever. Also I get that its a message you'ved used for a long time but I think you are big enough to stop blaming the end user when you cannot keep up with capacity."

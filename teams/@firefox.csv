"@firefox What are possible negative implications of this? I'm all for the initiative, but not sure if this can be truly stopped"
"@firefox Will Google Analytics be blocked? I'm worried this could cause site owners to see no evidence of FF users on their site, leading to web devs not testing design/functional changes on Firefox."

"Hi people of @firefox! I see your post however, it isn't clear to me completely. Do you remove all cross-site tracking at TLD or TLD + 1 level like in ITP? Is there a partitioned shared cookie for SSO purposes in this approach? Do you apply any models to differentiate trackers?"
"@firefox Nope, nothing :/"

@firefox Good choice!
@RalfSauer3 @firefox ... and by not sending users to shady default DNS servers they never chose?
"@firefox No, nothing =/ pic.twitter.com/rRlPFvg5za"
"@firefox Thanks Firefox! Looking forward to more reading material on this to be able to make decisions re tracker blockers accordingly. It's probably too early for tech media to report on this, wonder if they'll emphasise the no-need-for-tracker-blockers angle in their upcoming reports."
"@firefox @MicrosoftEdge needs this, too."

@firefox Thank you from an original Netscape user who graduated to Firefox and never went to the darkside of Internet Exploder!When can we expect this new version?

"@firefox Thanks for the reply! I'll give it a try. I was worried about using 3rd party for such a sensitive thing, but a quick look through the source makes me feel better.  He didn't roll his own crypto, at least..."
@firefox WHAT'S WORKING IN2018... to produce results? Who is sharing the wealth? Nice
"@TJMac93 @firefox Sorry for the inconvenience, Tom. You can install your language pack by clicking 'View classic desktop site' in the footer and then 'View other versions' on the add-on page. This is a bug that will be fixed soon. https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/4935¬†‚Ä¶"

"@firefox That will be especially good for users who don't currently use add-ons to block tracking.  Google and Facebook track everyone across millions of websites, following them around. This occurs, even if you don't have a Google or Facebook account. #DeleteFacebook #Facebook #Google"
@firefox Firefox is just taking features from other browsers now smh You became less appealing to me than Google Chrome
@kaykas @firefox You promise? pic.twitter.com/TnPdMQNmnO
"@firefox This is great news Firefox, thank you! Does this mean no need for users to install tracker blocker like Ghostery & Privacy Badger any more? Or there's still good use for those?"
@firefox Only enable your own tracking by default
@firefox Great improvements... now don't fire employees whose political positions you don't agree with and you will really be on the right track. Be Brave make the changes that protect individual liberties and freedoms.
@firefox Long tine loyal Firefox user. Please tell this ISN'T ad blocking!
@firefox
@firefox The Yahoo search that is there now will make me quit using Firefox
"@firefox you are forcing me to install chrome, because you don‚Äôt got support for lighthouse üò´"
@firefox what do you want in exchange for a #MinVid rollout? I‚Äôm open to‚Ä¶ arrangements
"@firefox with its reader view & Pocket integration is the perfect ""web reader"" app, for clean pages that don't irritate your eyes or hurt your brain. pic.twitter.com/Ye7WbIwf0G"
"@firefox thanks for let me know, was strange cause came drectly when opening firefox, y deleted cookies and everithing!"
@firefox is true this?? pic.twitter.com/WETYq6Fx1C
"@firefox I have. Most of them I have already done over the last few weeks, including the refresh step. I don't know what's going on. I can't even play FB videos anymore without them lagging so bad on FF. Chrome, they work fine, but I like FF a lot more and wish I knew what was going on."
@firefox Okay. My FF is so slow here lately. I ran my adware/virus and it's clean. Cleared all my cookies/cache/temp files. Pretty much have done everything. Rebooted and it's still slower than usual. Makes me sad. :( I can't figure out what's wrong. I have good high speed internet too.
"@firefox Why do I have multiple processes running in my task manager? It's so hard to use Firefox anymore because of this. I only have one FF window open, but in my task manager, I see 4 Firefox processes. how do I fix this?"
@LastPass @firefox clearly has now slowed down... #firefox may have improvement itself but handling of addons remains pathetic..@lastpass is one addon that loads over a minute..
@WPESupport @mozilla @firefox I think that problem is @Google because this happens too with @gitlab  http://gitlab.com¬†. Both domains are hosted by @googlecloud.
"@mozilla @firefox Thanks for answer, maybe @WPESupport block us for use Tor Network from my actual location. But I tried from different places in #Cuba and from none  http://blog.mozilla.org¬† is accessible. Can't be possible for whole Cuba to use Tor."

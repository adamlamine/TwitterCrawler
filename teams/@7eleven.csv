@7eleven Went to my local 7-11 today and there were like 5 special needs adults hired to clean and straighten things up - well done!
@7eleven I figured... just making a joke.
@7eleven my app keeps adding punches for drinks I didn't buy. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
@7eleven you need to address the slow pumps ASAP!! â€“ at MoneyGram (in 7-ELEVEN VCOM)
@7eleven have the best pickles
@7eleven when we get those danque pumkin spice lattes again. Can't wait
@7eleven @realDonaldTrump Why is it that 7 eleven only hires Hindu people around my area?
@7eleven please convey the importance of having working refrig units in the summer when custmrs want cold drinks. Also the air is a problem. I've seen product in the store that looks compromised because of the rental a/c units
@7eleven disappointed with you guys again. Just finished a 5k run went to one of your locations at chambers st in NYC near the a/c train. All of the beverages in display case hot!!!! The store has had make shift rental a/c's for 2 summers
@7eleven can you refill a big gulp
@7eleven Iâ€™m a fan but this product sucks and it nothing close to as advertised. pic.twitter.com/VhX7tKKscZ
"@7eleven No need to DM, Ive already left that cesspool that is america. I went to a few of your locations. All smelt foul of body odor. Seems as if some cultures fail to realise nobody wants to smell sweaty armpits. Should really have guidlines for cleanliness and customer comfort."
@7eleven Done and done
@7eleven is your pumpkin spice latte in store yet and I was hoping you could tell me who you buy the powder from because I need it
"@7eleven. This location is perfect for a new store. 226 w.alma st san jose, ca95125. This location does not have a close 7-11 for the community. A lot of neighborhoods in this location. Thank You pic.twitter.com/sVWJhiixC6"
@7eleven open in the uk
@AirheadsCandy @7eleven The white air heads are Watermelon flavor. Every now and then they are blue raspberry flavor
@7eleven @redbull what does this even mean? I can't find anything on it pic.twitter.com/Bma9E8JZNc
@7eleven this store at the corner of N. Harbor blvd and Hazard has the best staff. This location is spotless and very attentive. It was nice getting respect from a very young staff. I stop at a 7eleven 10 times a day. Its refreshing to see someone give a shit. pic.twitter.com/OsgTuUCqin
"@7eleven You guys rock! Love your app, franchisees and employees. You should add public restrooms though to curb public urination, which happens way too often around town (and I unfortunately have a knack for noticing)."
"@7eleven Will the pumpkin flavored hot coffee be returning this year? If so, when can we expect it to show up in stores?"
@7eleven Eagerly awaiting your response
@7eleven Still waiting On a response from you regarding your store owner chasing us with a pair of scissors #sociopath
@7eleven A little jerky wouldn't hurt either!!
@7eleven I did but didn't get a response back
@7eleven I have a complaint this certain store is always closed for 12-1 why? I thought it was 24 hours
@7eleven need to be investigated
@7eleven DM sent. Please let me know what information you would like.
@7eleven BRUH THIS SHIT FROM 2016 WHAT YALL DOIN???? pic.twitter.com/9Ed7shtb14

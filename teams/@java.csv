Explicit conversion (unchecked on top of that) is code smell. That's definitely not a good example of inheritance. You can do better @DZone and @java
@java Wouldn't need to have scarred Java with the first two 'practices' (hacks) if the designers had only the humility to admit that destructors are a wonderful idea for relinquishing resources. It's just painfully obvious.

"@nicolas_frankel @java Seems cumbersome to me if it's not optional. Much rather like the way spec works for #clojure where optionally you use predicates to describe what goes in and out, and use it for generative testing."

@java Having every promoted tweet in my Twitter feed mentioning it ;)
@java)) Making immutable class using Java 8. You need a constructor.
@trisha_gee @java if your generators create actual uncompiled source boilerplate then why not imply it instead?
@trisha_gee @java Yes it is
@trisha_gee @java Thanks for sharing.
@trisha_gee @java Of course not! It's just not as good as not boilerplate:p
@java 😀

"@trisha_gee @java Good sample, I have been through this myself, so:The method should not take an optional, it should make an optional out of a nullable parameter.Having already joined general predicate, ""if contains this, it should be X or Y"" done ahead helps clarity.Java needs FP's Either..."
@trisha_gee @java Well having a code multiple times around doesn't prove to be an efficient way going around. Simplification is much needed to focus more on business logic than on code .

@antonarhipov @java how many decades do we have to wait for string interpolation? 😶
@java what would be the recommended strategy to have Java in production after Sept 2018? Use OpenJDK + update prod env every 6 months? Paying the Oracle's LTS having a large deployment in cloud could not be an option for many... https://twitter.com/giltene/status/1023284405559652352 …
@java Hey @headius! Some of your performance measurements look strange. Can you share the full setup and measurement methodologies publicly so we can reproduce? Thanks!

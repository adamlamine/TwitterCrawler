@Prince_ajh @McDonalds These are sooooo good! I'm already addicted
@McDonalds I was in the drive thru waiting for my coffee drink when the manager of the store used the spoon to stir the coffee drinks with to open boxes with.  Then places the spoon back on the machine to use for drinks.  Will not buy McDonald s anymore.
"@McDonalds Then they messed up my order, giving me 8, when I paid for 10, but that's ok bcuz in the end I ended up with 18 pieces of nasty chicken strips!!!"
@McDonalds You know what else my grandma loves. Not having diabetes.

"@McDonalds McD failing in Canada. ""24 hr"" locations turning away over 1000 customers per night per location."
@McDonalds did you think I wouldn't notice that you ran out of hot fudge for my sundae and used chocolate syrup instead? I paid $.40 for that extra hot fudge.
@McDonalds it's hilarious how there's at least an inch missing every time I order a large Coke. Shouldn't program y'all's drink machines to dispense less than what I paid for. Fucking bums.
"@McDonalds I use the app, thanks. But it does seem unfair to people without smart phones."

"@McDonalds The manager in the Boynton Beach Congress Avenue location was extremely rude to me tonight. Me and my family won't be going back to that location, and unfortunately that's the closest one so we probably won't be going back to any location soon after tonight"
"@McDonalds I WANT MIGHTY WINGS BACK, and if you put glazed honey BBQ on them that would be even better."
@McDonalds The manager at the Boynton Beach location could definitely use some customer service training classes. He was extreeeeemely rude! Me and my family definitely won't be going back to that location!

"@McDonalds They may be sweet and spicy, but real bready too! Not very good!"
"@McDonalds It's ashame that you guys allow anyone to be a manager in your stores. You put these illiterate, disrespectful people in management positions. They should take proper etiquette classes. This Applied to the McDonald's on Davison Parkway Stockbridge GA, 30281 overnight"
@McDonalds I really wish your adds would stop showing up on my timeline. Every time I eat at your establishment no matter what location. I always get sick in the stomach. Sorry but your practices of fast vs food is horrendous. Money scammers.

"@McDonalds Just because you used the word ""grandma"", hmmmm."
@McDonalds needs to bring back the McWraps
@McDonalds how to lose a customer for rest of live? Refusing to change with a defect toy because I do not having the purchase invoice.
"@McDonalds went to 1 in Giddings Texas, extremely disappointed. Part of my patty is missing & i thought there's supposed to be more pickles? Very disappointed. pic.twitter.com/7G3B1GGlN8"
@McDonalds this is unacceptable this is not how it looks on tv! It wasn’t even past the lid line. I was better off going to @quicktrip15 pic.twitter.com/l9YuHB2qre
"@McDonalds I've been to store #37519 on multiple occasions and every time I order a item I want, it's sold out. You need to get better logistics for this store."
"@McDonalds Sooo y'all serving dry Big Macs now? And also with these small ass patties? Asking for me from the store in Mobile,  Al on Dauphin Island Parkway! Also this is how they cook the food 95% the time.. but since this is the closest store to me 😒 pic.twitter.com/74wGo8zXNC"
@McDonalds  http://gofundme.com/reverie2018 
@McDonalds your Colleyville location changed it’s large iced coffee price from $1.08 to $2.48 and this has ruined my life
@McDonalds They gave me the McSquirts. #stayclosetohome
"@McDonalds For the most part, I have had pretty good experiences at McDonald’s. Today was the first of experiencing lackluster customer service at restaurant #3901 in Chicago. They will NEVER get my business again. I’m utterly disappointed to say the least."
"@McDonalds I just ordered 10 nugs, how are you going to give me ONE sweet n sour?"
@McDonalds When’s the new homunculus sandwich coming out? #cantwait

@McDonalds Boycott McDonald’s sponsor FOXNews. Don’t eat the salads unless you have a death wish.
@McDonalds y yo nuggs more expensive den burgerkings?
@McDonalds Thought you were gonna say sweet spicy and glazed jiat like her lmfao
@McDonalds Why is a hamburger 1.09 and a cheeseburger is a 1? That is not right! @Wendys is ur hamburger more than a cheeseburger?
@McDonalds These look nice
"@McDonalds it may be a joke on twitter, but in real life, broken ice cream machines are no laughing matter"
"@McDonalds BTS Citi Field concert P1 seats, that's where it'll take me."
@McDonalds this is what you cost me after your coupon failed me at the window. Maybe I should take to @Wendys and get my 4 for $4 next time. pic.twitter.com/LuNTcyfwfF
@McDonalds when is the mcrib coming back to ny?
@McDonalds I wish you all would take some tips from @ChickfilA and teach your employees customer service skills.
@McDonalds My order not getting screwed up 3x in a row across 2 different locations in a matter of weeks
@McDonalds These are good to btw @runwayrih
@McDonalds Yummy
@McDonalds why is the icecream machine always broken when I need it most
@McDonalds Fire🔥🔥🔥
@McDonalds 😀💞
@McDonalds  Two visits in a row with long drive through times wrong food and same manager.  I will have to drive out of my way to visit an actual McDonald's that can get my order correct
@McDonalds stop ruining my food and getting my order wrong every time. It says it on the ticket so why can’t it be made right?
@MikeyWax @McDonalds I'm loving it😘!!
"@McDonalds Hey McD's I'll give it a try, I hope for the best! But I still think of you as where to go when I'm hungry and broke. There's no shame there! Thank you for being the place for two McDoubles and a large Coke for under $4! For supporting young families and the working class!"
@McDonalds Has the winner of the McDonald's for Life contest already been notified?
@McDonalds just got out of the drive thru from waiting 10 minutes because they forgot my smoothie. Since I waited so long they gave me a coupon... the coupon is expired! pic.twitter.com/SjxIIpUMaX
@McDonalds Only once a week now huh.
@MikeyWax @McDonalds fActs
@McDonalds hey I got a big issues... I found a dead spider in my cup.
@McDonalds Saw the commercial  with sweet n spicy  grandmothers. Extremely sexist. Not appropriate.
@McDonalds how many retweets for free McNuggets for a year 👀
@McDonalds Care to explain how waiting 20 minutes for “curbside” service and still have to go in to see my food sitting on the counter “curbside”? Thanks.
"@McDonalds Haha 😂 ""hand tossed"""
@McDonalds why’d you get rid of the cold brew frozen coffees? they were 🔥🔥🔥
@McDonalds These look worth trying! Hmmm pic.twitter.com/1jFkKfUzYA
@McDonalds gusto kong fries 😢😢😢😢
@McDonalds Hol tf up.
@MikeyWax @McDonalds Little things as in 1D's hit single little things? Sure we love u
"@McDonalds drove up to McDonald’s and had a coupon “buy a breakfast sandwich and get a free frappe or smoothie” I ordered that with a frappe and they said “machine broke” so I ordered a smoothie “machine broke” yet again🙄 then I ordered a normal COFFEE, yet again “machine broke”"
@McDonalds #AnimalCruelty #Cancer #Disease #pollution

@McDonalds maybe grandma can get her salad tossed too
@McDonalds Can we get Grilled Chicken Tenders on the menu?
@McDonalds when most fast food is relatively the same what makes the difference is convenience and service. The Church Street location in Murfreesboro Tennessee offers neither convenience or service. I think even an apology would have sufficed but that was too much to expect.
@McDonalds horrible experience at McDonald's. My kids love the McChicken sandwiches we ordered 3 not 1 the bag. When we called and inform them of the missing food my wife was hung up on. We drove back my wife went inside and was basically told to go away. #Notlovingit
"@McDonalds Ordered 9 cheeseburgers for the fam last night. Terrible health choice, I know. Got home and 3 of them had no meat, just a bun with ketchup, also didn’t get the sauce i paid for. Why am I not surprised ?"
@McDonalds They are really good but grandma has enough on that plate for the whole family!
"@McDonalds mobile ordering hmmm sounds great! However on two occasions I’ve used it one being tonight, I had to wait over 5 minutes for my food 6 minutes tonight and counting. So I’m wondering y use this aside from the occasional bogo? pic.twitter.com/Ttn0wKPBGo"
@McDonalds I guess this adds up. pic.twitter.com/zCHJzUVZ1v
@McDonalds These were fire
@McDonalds Hot n spicy chicken nuggets...think about it
"@McDonalds my sisters car broke down this morning so she took refuge under your golden arches hoping to put a smile back on her face she got food to wait for a ride, bad luck struck again. they had to lock the doors because of a potential gas leak! She needs golden Arch Support!!"
@McDonalds That is NOT my grandmother

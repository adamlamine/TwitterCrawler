@amazon I recently read about your cancelation of the 20% off video game pre orders that came as part of amazon prime.  You replaced it with a less than lucrative benefit program.  That was a bad move. I no longer have a reason to pre order video games on amazon.

"@amazon @TwitchPrime The only reason I had Amazon Prime was for the 20% off video game pre-orders. It's why i first got prime. You took that away, so now I will cancel my subscription. I don't order enough other stuff online to warrant the recent hiked price for Prime."
@amazon please make it so you can skip intros in #prime #videos. I don't need to see the intro every time I watch a #tv show
@amazon Thanks for slamming all the prices up by $10-$15 each on all the new releases. Just made sure I had the funds and went to pay and now it going to cost me an extra $50. I guess it's my fault. I shouldn't make sure I can afford things.

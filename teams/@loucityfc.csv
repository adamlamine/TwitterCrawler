@loucityfc The SeatGeek website was having issues. It did finally load. Thanks for the quick reply. If only I would have had a promo code. 😉
@loucityfc Love this hole.
@loucityfc Love this aerial view. You can really see the site taking shape

@ModeloUSA @loucityfc The turf monster.
"@loucityfc Ummmmmm, I took advantage of the 2 year renewal option before the season started."
@loucityfc I really like this. Good job guys 👌🏼😌🔶🔷
@howielindsey @loucityfc Try not messing with a winning lineup.

"@loucityfc I don't care, I only attend these games to forget my miserable existance."
@loucityfc Hahahahahahahahaha
@loucityfc Toronto had our number. They constantly reversed the ball on the attack and had 2 men to our 1 on the opposite side. And then there were the numerous off side penalties when ever we would score. Discipline and bad luck. We played tired.

"@loucityfc is still in 2nd place, is still full of talent, still has a huge purple family, & has another match Friday!  #PurpleFamily pic.twitter.com/BNWjhuPoKb"
@loucityfc I remember when they got beat 4-0 at home to Montreal 2 in our first year.  Not worried

@loucityfc Lots going on and you viewed this as a lower priority match. You got caught napping. Use it as a reminder during training for the rest of the season.
"@loucityfc IDK... Richmond might disagree. A 0:6 home loss??? Nasty business, for sure"
@loucityfc Well you can’t really get much worse
@loucityfc HAHAHA get rekt
"@loucityfc You guys realize that was TFC II, not TFC right? Toronto had zero points on the road this season (0-0-10).Tonight is the first time in the sad existence of TFC II franchise history (116 games) in which they won by 3+ goals. Expect more from the boys in purple."
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc Nobody

@loucityfc Jajajajajaja jajajajajaja HAHAHAHAH
@loucityfc congrats to @hackworthsoccer on the worst home loss in franchise history. Welcome!
@loucityfc Rough game.
"@loucityfc Not good enough for the Champs, but we’re ok. Regroup, refocus, and attack. We’ve got this. 💪🏽💜"
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc Nah
@loucityfc Well maybe if you hired a real coach we wouldnt be embarrassing ourselves.
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc No one
@loucityfc Lol wow
@loucityfc 8' of stoppage for 15 min of Toronto walking and laying in the grass...
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc We lost bro
"@ModeloUSA @loucityfc Umm... I know that @modeloUSA has to get their guaranteed advertisement tweet (and I know it’s a Mexican beer and a Canadian team), but I’m pretty sure you mean Tsubasa Endoh for Man of the Match 🇨🇦🍺👍🏻 #MolsonManofTheMatch"
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc How bout no one?
@ModeloUSA @loucityfc I just can't. I love them all but MOTM is the supporters still at slugger.

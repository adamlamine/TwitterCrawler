"@Sony @SONYtelevision1 @PlayStation , your license DRM bullshit that cause me to lose access to ALL of my games until I connect it to the Internet is absolutely unacceptable, this is my hardware, not yours! I am now selling this PS4 and NEVER buying another game from you."

"@Sony Aye, can we get backwards compatibility? Or can you give us the ability to play with other consoles. Like I love the PlayStation series but Xbox and Nintendo is just making you look lacking. I say this because I want PlayStation to succeed. Put your pride away."
@Sony These new tomb raider games are amazing!!!
@Sony makes so many bad movies if they were to stop film maker people would rejoice

@Sony @PlayStation Make PlayStation “For the Players” rather than “For the Money” #enablecrossplayps4
@Sony is cheap. Just allow cross platform play. The CEO is only think about how much money he has now and not thinking about how much he or the company will make if cross platform play is a thing.

@Sony Is there a way to get my Bravia WF6 to remember my selected favourites? Every time I turn it on its defaulted to all stations again.
"@Sony @PlayStation give us #crossplay it's2018. 2019 is around the corner, New consoles will be coming out everybody wants to cross play but you.  Probably gonna fall behind again like you did with the PlayStation 3 then you'll be crying for cross play but it'll be too late🙄"

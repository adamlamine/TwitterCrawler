@CIA Just like this.  You're sitting there I bet wondering how this could happen!  All the while you've watched crimes committed for years.  Unanimous approval FBI Director!  That's the special counsel.  It's an abdication of the current FBI because they're probably all old cases.
@CIA He must have been taking the paperwork demonstrating the military laundered money via a cartel in the Carribean as an alternate theory to the SFG investigation.  Then following that paper trail to Iraq.  Then claiming Iraq was the reason they laundered money.

@CIA Ferris Mueller missing all the crimes.  They were right under his nose more than likely and they labeled it a white line related to national security right before leaving the beltway.
@CIA It must be because he's a Marine.  So is General Dunford.  So were the Marines arrested for rape in New Orleans.  That must mean people in the higher levels of the military are subject to the law.

@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory It’s 2016..the game is tied 2-2. We where facing our school rivals in our Senior night. I get knocked down near the box with 2 minutes left on the clock. I adjust the ball and the whole team comes down to support the play. I cross the ball and BAM!We win the game😤
@NashvilleSC That last goal could be up for goal of the week.
@RopapaMensah @NashvilleSC Love that @Boushwa22 print.
@garyashton @NashvilleSC I overheard a well dress man tell another well dress man that the turnstile number was 3500.  Not bad for a school night.
@NashvilleSC sort of curious why TB Washington has not been in the line up?
@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory. I've always loved playing soccer as a child and I love watching soccer as an adult I would be thrilled to be able to attend the event
"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer #MySoccerStory is unfortunately non-existent, but I’m hoping to start one with #OurTownOurClub, @NashvilleSC. Also, I like #Merica and I like to have a damn good time. #USAUSAUSA"
"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC This is my #MySoccerStory Giving the gift of the greatest game to the third generation. I played growing up from my father and now it is their turn. This game teaches teamwork, leadership, and passion. They have learned so much that will stay with them through the years. pic.twitter.com/kb9cbFYOt1"

"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC I’ve never actually played soccer, but I’ve won the World Cup with the US National team on FIFA. #MySoccerStory"
@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory began back in 2014 when I was on a lunch break doing yard work with my best friend at his aunts. We ate sandwiches and watched Brazil. A year later I went to my first match and it was USA-Guatemala in Nashville where USA won 4-0.
"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #mysoccerstoryI played soccer for years and was a starting defender on my high school team as a freshman. But I had a career ending injury requiring 3 surgeries at 14. But even so, soccer still brings me so much joy and community. I’m so happy to see it gaining traction in Nash"
"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory I used to play but when I realized I wasn’t good, I became a referee. I’ve been to Texas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina for R3 President’s Cup 2016-18 to represent Tennessee and was named one of the top 15 Assistant Refs this year."
"@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC Love watching my twins play. The other day at their game, the only 2 goals scored were by my boys. One twin assisted, while the other twin made the goal!"
@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory  I Love Nashville & this Club I Hope We Can Bring As Many Trophies As Possible & Lets Just Say Theirs No other club like this One Its Unique

@miseleccionmxEN @ussoccer_mnt @ussoccer @NashvilleSC #MySoccerStory Itâ€™s 2016..the game is tied 2-2. We where facing our school rivals in our Senior night. I get knocked down near the box with 2 minutes left on the clock. I adjust the ball and the whole team comes down to support the play. I cross the ball and BAM!We win the gameðŸ˜¤
@NashvilleSC That last goal could be up for goal of the week.
@RopapaMensah @NashvilleSC Love that @Boushwa22 print.

@DOTA2 and some of those predictions are even more absurd. How many trees are gonna get cut down...how many smoke gank kills...etc the answer to these questions are based on PURE LUCK.
@DOTA2 50 Main Battle Predictions is ridiculous. I have 43/44 achievements because of it. You cant expect someone to watch these games for 5 days straight on a M-F...people WORK.  Very upset about this.
"@DOTA2 @redditdota2 great that you guys extended the battle pass and all but why can't we buy levels? Pleaseee let us, I only need like 100 levels to get the prestige bundle. üò¢"

@BurgerKing I would like to know why your employees think it’s okay to serve a burger with a bun charred like the one I received. Does this look appetizing to you? 😡 pic.twitter.com/TkgL3KboaJ

@BurgerKing I thought I would try BK once again after getting sick off your food. I waited 10 mins no line and no one took my order until I get to the window and the sorry woman didn’t have her headset on. I’m thinking my food might no be fresh. It wasn’t hot!
@BurgerKing I really wish and request you would go back to the fries of the 80s/90s. They were far superior to what you have now and with them I was able to get the occasional great squiggly one with the burnt end. #burgerking #bringbackbetterfries
